# Artificial-Intelligence-Guide
This is an Artificial Intelligence learning and Interview guide. 
I help this guide can help you to be a Machine Engineer in Tencent.

## 1. Program Language(important) 
### 1.1 C/C++ or Java
1. [C Language](docs/Languages/CLanguage.md)
2. [C++ Language](docs/Languages/C++Language.md)

#### object-oriented program
SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for 5 design principles of object-oriented programming intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. These principles were first introduced in Robert C.Martin's 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns.
1. The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
2. The Open-closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification"
3. The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes"

Data Analysis

## 2. Machine Learning Algorithm(important)
10 common machine learning algorithm
#### Supervised Learning
监督学习提供对错指示、告知最终答案。要实现的目标是"对于输入数据X能预测变量Y"
Supervised learning generally includes two types: classification and regression. 
The target variable of the classification problem is only valued in a limited 
target set(nominal type). For example, the simplest handwritten digit recognition 
problem, the target result is in the set{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. The target variable 
of the regression problem is numerical, that is, you can take a value from an 
infinite set of values, such as predicting the price of a Lego toy set, it may be 
any number you image.
Several commonly used algorithms in supervised learning:  
1. K-nearest neighbor algorithm
2. Decision tree algorithm
3. Naive Bayes algorithm

#### Unsupervised Learning
在没有老师的情况下，学生自学的过程。要回答的问题是"从数据X中能发现什么"
Several commonly used algorithms in unsupervised learning:
1. K-means clustering algorithm
2. Spectral clustering algorithm
3. Principal component analysis(PCA)
