## 1. Program Language 
### C/C++ or Java

#### object-oriented program
SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for 5 design principles of object-oriented programming intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. These principles were first introduced in Robert C.Martin's 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns.
1. The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
2. The Open-closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification"
3. The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes"
